Plan of attack, 

Technical side: 
- build proper logging so everything can be logged. 
- build a proper login system that works, even with set permissions per page. 
- build a proper blog style system
- Make it plugable, so it works with all other huge installations. 

UI Side: 
- build a admin ui. 
- create a user frontend?
